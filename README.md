# Weetabix

This tool demonstrates a PoC technique for enumerating Windows Fibers from process memory allowing defenders to distinguish legitimate from malicious Fiber use.

Weetabix identifies which Threads are running Fibers then extracts:
* The currently executing Fiber.
* Any associated Dormant Fibers.
* Their Fiber Data.
* Their Fiber local storage slots.
* And any associated Fiber callback functions in use.

Weetabix then applies a set of enrichments such as memory protections, symbol+module resolutions & entropy scores to allow one to distinguish legitimate from malicious fiber use.

## NOTE
* This tool requires symbols to be correctly configured on Windows for callback symbol resolution.
* PoC was tested on Windows 10 19044. Targets x64 processes.
