# Weetabix

This tool demonstrates a PoC technique for enumerating Windows Fibers from process memory allowing defenders to distinguish legitimate from malicious Fiber use.

Weetabix identifies which Threads are running Fibers then extracts:
* The currently executing Fiber.
* Any associated Dormant Fibers.
* Their Fiber Data.
* Their Fiber local storage slots.
* And any associated Fiber callback functions in use.

Weetabix then applies a set of enrichments such as memory protections, symbol+module resolutions & entropy scores to allow one to distinguish legitimate from malicious fiber use.

## Detection Use Cases with sample output from Weetabix

#### Malicious callback manipulation
Tested against an attack tool that overwrites a default Fiber local storage callback function. The malicious callback function is executed whenever the fiber/thread exists or the associated fiber loca storage slot is freed. 

Weetabix finds two suspicous callbacks
1. A callback to a mapped module in the Downloads directory.
2. A callback into unbacked RWX memory.

#### Unorthodox use of Fibers by CobaltStrike's Artifact kit when using Thread Stack Spoofing
This reveals only a single fiber being used on a thread. This is irregular since Fibers were designed with multi-tasking in mind so one would expect two or more fibers/Thread. In addition 
1. FiberData points to unbacked memory.
2. There is no Fiber local storage which is non-standard behaviour.
3. There are no callbacks functions which is non-standard behaviour.

## NOTE
* This tool requires symbols to be correctly configured on Windows for callback symbol resolution.
* PoC was tested on Windows 10 19044. Targets x64 processes.
